# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is a set of syntax that checks to see if a condition is met or not allowing the next chain of commands to process.

Researched answer: Conditional statements are commands handling decisions using an if statement to determine if the boolean value is true or false.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Honestly, for the most part I thought they were the same thing. I think git allows the process of uploading and downloading repositories from GitHub, and Github was just a storage of repositories and a way for devs to work with one another online.

Researched answer:
Git is an open source version control system used in the programming world that tracks changes in source code. 
GitHub allows devs to share and store code making use of Git version control to do so.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer:An array's index is the location of said thing in the array, and it's value is what it holds. For example, using the array: let myArray = ["chocolate", "milk"], [1] would be the index of "milk" and "milk" would be the value of the index of [1]

Researched answer: Elements in arrays are the value. Indexes are the sequential numbers like an address for the element in the array.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: They both can contain numbers and text, however the numbers in a string would be part of a text and not able to be manipulated with mathamatical methods. Many methods work for both arrays and strings, however some only apply to strings or arrays. It can be handy transforming a string into an array or vice versa to complete a specific method.

Researched answer: Arrays and strings hava a lot of similar properties. They are a collection of items, have length propety, and are zero indexed. Strings have differences, but it doesn't say so... huh.  Convenient to convert strings into arrays and vice-versa.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?
I have no idea. Remain square at all times to achieve inner peace, circle around loops until resolved, triangulate the syntax one line at a time, and Rectify all differences avoiding TypeErrors at all cost.



Researched answer:
data abstraction: The process of hiding unnecessary details of an object's internal structure. Keeping the structure and behavior seperate.

encapsulation: wrapping data related function into a single unit (object). 

inheritance: creating a new class from an existing one

polymorphism: object takes on multiple forms

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: A built in metho in javascript that takes in a function as an argument. Designed to operate on arrays.

2. Jest: A javascript testing framework

3. Objects: consist of collections of key value pairs stored in curly braces.
